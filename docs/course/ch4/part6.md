## Indices of

The most used searching function is the dyadic _indices of_, which shares its symbol with the index function `⍳`.

!!! note "Typing the indices of function `⍳`"

    Prefix method: <kbd>PREFIX</kbd> <kbd>i</kbd>

    Tab method: <kbd>i</kbd> <kbd>i</kbd> ++tab++

If you want a simple way to find a value in an array, `⍳` is your guy.
On the left, you give it an array to search in; on the right, you give it an array of values to find.
The function will output the indices where your values are located.
