!!! write-problem "Write problem 1"
    Create a function that calculates the harmonic mean of its left and right arguments, mathematically defined as $$H(\alpha,\omega) = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{\alpha}+\frac{1}{\omega}}$$
    <div class="problem">
        <span class="problemspan">H←</span>
        <input class="probleminput" type="text" id="input_ch3_p1" placeholder="your solution here">
        <button class="problembutton" onclick="submit_problem('ch3_p1', 2)">Submit</button>
    </div>
    <p id="feedback_ch3_p1" style="color: red"></p>

!!! write-problem "Write problem 2"
    Create a function that calculates the Heronian mean of its left and right arguments, mathematically defined as $$H(\alpha,\omega) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot (A+\sqrt{AB}+B)$$
    <div class="problem">
        <span class="problemspan">H←</span>
        <input class="probleminput" type="text" id="input_ch3_p2" placeholder="your solution here">
        <button class="problembutton" onclick="submit_problem('ch3_p2', 2)">Submit</button>
    </div>
    <p id="feedback_ch3_p2" style="color: red"></p>
