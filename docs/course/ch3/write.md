# Write exercises

Submit APL code for the following exercises.
Your submissions are graded using TMC.

Make sure to [log in](../../login.md) to be able to submit your work!

Remember, you can test out ideas and develop you solution at [TryAPL](https://tryapl.org) before submitting it here.

You can submit as many solutions as you like.
If you submit a correct solution at least once, you will receive points on the TMC server and be able to see the model solution.

If the write problem is red, it is unsolved. If it it green, you have solved it and received points for it on the server.

## Dfns

!!! write-problem "Write problem 1"
    Write a dfn to calculate the arithmetic mean of the two arguments. The arithmetic mean of $a$ and $b$ is $\dfrac{a + b}{2}$.
    <div class="problem">
        <span class="problemspan">⎕←</span>
        <input class="probleminput" type="text" id="c1_p1" placeholder="your solution here">
        <button class="problembutton" onclick="alert('c3_p1')">Submit</button>
    </div>

!!! write-problem "Write problem 2"
    Write a dfn to calculate the geometric mean of the two arguments. The geometric mean of $a$ and $b$ is $\sqrt{a\cdot b}$.
    <div class="problem">
        <span class="problemspan">⎕←</span>
        <input class="probleminput" type="text" id="c1_p1" placeholder="your solution here">
        <button class="problembutton" onclick="alert('c3_p2')">Submit</button>
    </div>

!!! write-problem "Write problem 3"
    Write a dfn to calculate the harmonic mean of the two arguments. The harmonic mean of $a$ and $b$ is $$\dfrac{2}{\dfrac{1}{a} + \dfrac{1}{b}}$$
    <div class="problem">
        <span class="problemspan">⎕←</span>
        <input class="probleminput" type="text" id="c1_p1" placeholder="your solution here">
        <button class="problembutton" onclick="alert('c3_p3')">Submit</button>
    </div>

## Math


!!! write-problem "Write problem 4"
    Write a dfn to convert the right argument given in "hhmmss" form to the number of seconds. For example, if the input is $130$, the output should be $90$ because 1'30" is $90$ seconds.
    <div class="problem">
        <span class="problemspan">⎕←</span>
        <input class="probleminput" type="text" id="c1_p1" placeholder="your solution here">
        <button class="problembutton" onclick="alert('c3_p4')">Submit</button>
    </div>

!!! write-problem "Write problem 5"
    Write a dfn to calculate the inverse of problem 4, that is, convert the number of seconds to "hhmmss" form.
    <div class="problem">
        <span class="problemspan">⎕←</span>
        <input class="probleminput" type="text" id="c1_p1" placeholder="your solution here">
        <button class="problembutton" onclick="alert('c3_p5')">Submit</button>
    </div>
