# Welcome to the wonderful world of APL programming!

APL is quirky, different, and not like the other programming languages.

One December, I was doing the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) (AoC) challenges.
These are fun, small programming projects that are given to you in the form of a Christmas advent calendar.
There are 2 challenges per day, for a grand total of 50 throughout December.

Throughout the month, text like this was posted on forums:

```apl
east  ← ⊢{(⍺+¯1⌽⍵)-⍵}     0∘<∧0=1∘⌽   ⍝ (1)!
```

1. Example taken from <https://github.com/pitr/aoc/blob/main/2021/25.apl>

I was very confused.
These were meant to be _solutions_ to the AoC problems.
However, I couldn't see how in the world these could represent any sort of algorithm, much less a solution.
Were these...

- Encrypted solutions?
- Solutions encoded in some weird format?
- Trolls meant to confuse me?
- My computer bugging out?

Turns out, it was none of these.
After a bit more research, I found out that it was something called **APL**.

!!! tip "APL"

    **APL** stands for...
    
    **A**
    
    **P**rogramming
    
    **L**anguage.

    Great naming, right?

Out of curiosity, I tried finding APL solutions to the AoC challenges after Christmas passed.
At one point, I found a solution that spanned just 50 lines.
As a note, a Python solution for _one_ challenge (towards the end of the month) is usually about 150-200 lines long.
In its 50 lines, the APL solution apparently solved _all_ the problems.

That was cool.

APL looks different, feels different, and it challenges your normal way of thinking about programming.

I hope that this course will expand your mind and let you approach programming from a whole new perspective.
