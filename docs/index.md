# APL MOOC

This is an online course on array programming in APL.
No prior array programming knowledge is required;
however, being familiar with at least one "normal" programming language is highly recommended.

This course is a work-in-progress.
When complete, it is intended to be an official 5 ECTS credit course at the University of Helsinki.

Course developed and written by Sergey Ichtchenko (sergey.ichtchenko[at]helsinki.fi).

Thank you to [Dyalog Ltd.](https://dyalog.com) for collaborating on this MOOC.
