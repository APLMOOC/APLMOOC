# APL MOOC

This is an online course on array programming in APL.
No prior array programming knowledge is required;
however, being familiar with at least one other programming language is highly recommended.

This course is a work-in-progress.
When complete, it is intended to be an official 5 ECTS credit course at the University of Helsinki.

Course developed and written by Sergey Ichtchenko (sergey.ichtchenko[at]helsinki.fi), Dani Adham (dani.adham[at]helsinki.fi), and Hex.
