By using the different modes outlined above, alongside APL workspaces and an APL IDE, you can write any programs you like. Thankfully, since we live in the year 2022, some APL developers have realised that it might be smart to finally get with the times and let programmers write their code in text files that are executed by an APL interpreter.

But wait, why is the negative sign before the number 3 rendered weirdly? It looks different from the minus sign we typed.</p> <p>As it turns out, there are two signs for negation in APL. One of them is a minus function (<code>-</code>), that subtracts two numbers. The other is a negative sign (<code>\u00af</code>), which is slightly higher and tells APL that a number is negative. The negative sign is not a function! In the same way that a full stop (<code>.</code>) decorates a number (<code>3.14159</code>) to show that it has a decimal part, the negative sign (<code>\u00af</code>) decorates a number (<code>\u00af1337</code>) to show that it's negative.</p> <p>Functions</p> <p>In APL, functions take in arguments and produce results.</p> <p>Most APL symbols are functions.

There are lots of symbols implemented in Unicode even today just because they were invented by APL'ers before any proper standards were written.</p> <p>You will learn how to type them shortly!</p> <p>In fact, the creators of APL added a special multiplication cross (<code>\u00d7</code>) to do multiplication. Not to be confused with the letter <code>x</code>!

Instead of doing the arithmetic operations in the normal order, 2 times 2 and add 1 (PEMDAS, remember?) APL seems to have done them in the reverse order, 2 plus 1 and the whole thing times 2. Let's see why that is.</p> <p>The creators of APL were faced with a dillemma. Every new symbol they added to the language was to be considered a function. In other languages, like Python, functions take in arguments inside parentheses. However, in APL, functions only take in arguments from the left and right. Because of this, all functions look and act like the multiplication and addition functions, and it isn't clear in which order they should be executed (e.g. consider the new symbol <code>1\u230a2+2</code>: would you perform the addition first or whatever this new <code>\u230a</code> function does first?) So, for every new function they added, the creators would have to decide where to put it in the hierarchy. And this doesn't even take into account functions that programmers can create themselves!</p> <p>\"Screw it,\" the creators decided, and made one, solid, unambiguous, easy-to-remember rule.</p> <p>Order of execution</p> <p>In APL, all operations are executed right-to-left.</p> <p>When APL runs a line of code, it first looks at the rightmost function symbol   and executes it with the arguments to its left and right.   It then looks at the function symbol to the left of the one just processed,   and executes it, treating the result it just got as a right argument.</p> <p>An equivalent formulation of this would be</p> <p>Order of execution</p> <p>In APL, every function takes in the whole expression on its right as a right argument.</p> <p>Can you see why these two formulations are equivalent?</p> <p>Example</p> <p>Suppose you have the expression <code>3+5\u00f70.25\u00d76*10-8</code>.</p> <p>This will get evaluated right-to-left as:   <pre><code>3+5\u00f70.25\u00d76*10-8\n3+5\u00f70.25\u00d76*2\n3+5\u00f70.25\u00d736\n3+5\u00f79\n3+0.5555555556\n3.555555556\n</code></pre></p> <p>About spaces</p> <p>APL ignores extra spaces when processing statements.

Resist the urge. Use parentheses for readability, and when needed to change the order of operations. However, your code generally ends up cleaner if you can write it with as few parentheses as possible.</p> <p>In the above case, for example, we could have simply restructured the expression to be the following:</p> <pre><code>      1+2\u00d72\n5\n</code></pre> <p>No parentheses, and we get the correct answer!</p> <p>In general, when you have parentheses on the right, they are redundant. This is easier to understand in context. Consider the following expression:</p> <pre><code>      (1+(2\u00d7(3\u00f7(4-5))))\n\u00af5\n</code></pre> <p>In this case, all of the parentheses are unnecessary, since it is telling the APL interpreter to execute everything from right to left, which it would do anyway. So, in this case, you could achieve the same result with the shorter and more readable code:</p> <pre><code>      1+2\u00d73\u00f74-5\n\u00af5\n</code></pre> <p>Pretty, isn't it?</p> <p>Before we conclude, here are some tips on how to reduce parentheses in your code to avoid a parenthesis jungle:</p> <p>Reducing parentheses</p> <ol> <li>No APL expression needs to end with a closing parenthesis. It's redundant.<ul> <li>For example, the expression <code>(2\u00d73)+(4\u00d75)</code> can be rewritten as <code>(2\u00d73)+4\u00d75</code></li> </ul> </li> <li>You never need two consecutive closing parentheses. It's redundant.<ul> <li>For example, the expression <code>(2\u00d7(3+4))\u00f75</code> is equivalent to <code>(2\u00d73+4)\u00f75</code></li> </ul> </li> <li>If you can easily rewrite the expression to avoid parentheses, do so.<ul> <li>For example, the expression <code>((2\u00f73)+4)\u00d75</code> can be reversed to give <code>5\u00d74+2\u00f73</code></li> </ul> </li> <li>Do not shovel in extra parentheses in a panicked, desperate attempt to fix your code.   Do shovel in parentheses if it genuinely helps the readability of your code.</li> </ol> <p>This isn't to say that you should avoid using parentheses. They often help your thought process and improve understanding of the code. They do not slow down execution, so feel free to use as many as you'd like (and potentially reduce their amount afterwards)!</p> <p>This funny order of execution and the rules for placing parentheses might take getting used to.

This is what's called a shy operation in APL.</p> <p>It is convention to use capital letters for variable names in APL. You can also use lowercase letters, underscores, and numbers (but a variable name cannot start with a number). In addition, you can use the characters <code>\u2206</code> and <code>\u2359</code>, called delta and delta underbar. These have no special meaning, and can be used to separate parts of a variable.</p> <p>For example, all of the following are valid variable names: <pre><code>STATS2020       BalanceDiff       _Rate_of_change      \nSTATS\u22062020      \u2206Balance          _ROC\nS20             \u2206                 \u2359R\n</code></pre></p> <p>If you try creating a variable that starts with a number, it will cause a <code>SYNTAX ERROR</code>.</p> <p>We can use variables in place of a number.</p> <pre><code>      BANANA \u2190 3\n      BANANA-1\n2\n      BANANA\u00f72\n1.5\n      BANANA\u00d7BANANA\n9\n</code></pre> <p>Note that variables keep their value even if you perform operations with them. The only way to change a variable's value is to use the assignment operator again:</p> <pre><code>      BANANA \u2190 3\n      BANANA\n3\n      BANANA+1\n4\n      BANANA \u2190 0\n      BANANA\n0\n      BANANA+1\n1\n      BANANA \u2190 BANANA + 3\n      BANANA\n4\n</code></pre> <p>Notice, at the end there we did a common operation: increasing the value of a variable by some amount. This is such a common operation, that the creators of APL introduced a shorthand:</p> <pre><code>      BANANA +\u2190 3\n</code></pre> <p>This has the same effect as the earlier <code>BANANA \u2190 BANANA + 3</code>, but may save you some keystrokes. You can also use this same technique with all other APL functions, some more useful than others. With any function <code>F</code>, the expression <code>VAR F\u2190 X</code> will expand to become <code>VAR \u2190 VAR F X</code>.

Let\u2019s say you, the astronaut on the ISS, mistakenly bought a bunch of measuring equipment from America, and only found out later that all the readings are in Fahrenheit. Terrible news! After about 2000 milliseconds of googling about it, you found this formula to convert it into Celsius:</p> <p>Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9</p> <p>To test it out, you looked up the current room temperature reading, which says 72.1. You did the calculation in APL:</p> <pre><code>      (5 \u00d7 72.1 - 32) \u00f7 9\n22.27777778\n</code></pre> <p>Great! What\u2019s not so great is that, the temperature sensor has been left generating data for the whole week, and there is a bunch of readings to convert to Celsius.</p> <pre><code>      TEMP_F \u2190 71.2 71.4 73.3 73.0 73.1 72.8 72.5\n</code></pre> <p>You are going to spend ages plugging the data from this one sensor, and you have 200 of them lying around! Fortunately, APL is designed to deal with data assorted in a vector. You can:</p> <pre><code>      \u2395 \u2190 TEMP_CELSIUS \u2190 (5 \u00d7 TEMP_F - 32) \u00f7 9\n21.77777778 21.88888889 22.94444444 22.77777778 22.83333333 22.66666667 22.5\n</code></pre> <p>There\u2019s all the Celsius! What\u2019s going on here?</p> <p>In APL, all the basic arithmetic functions apply \u201ccomponent-wise\u201d. If you are familiar with functional programming in Python or maybe Haskell, you might know the <code>map</code> function, which applies another function to each element of a vector. In APL, this is done automatically for all the basic arithmetic functions, if one of the parameters is a scalar:</p> <pre><code>      TEMP_F - 32\n39.2 39.4 41.3 41 41.1 40.8 40.5\n      TEMP_F + 32\n103.2 103.4 105.3 105 105.1 104.8 104.5\n      32 - TEMP_F\n\u00af39.2 \u00af39.4 \u00af41.3 \u00af41 \u00af41.1 \u00af40.8 \u00af40.5\n      100+1 2 3      \u235d The space here takes precedent over +\n101 102 103\n</code></pre> <p>Now you can do arithmetic to a list of numbers however you like! Just use them in place of a scalar value.</p> <p>After figuring this out, you decided to also check the temperature reading of a sensor outside the ISS:</p> <pre><code>      TEMP_OUTSIDE \u2190 118.5 97.1 59.5 30.0 \u00af9.7 \u00af62.3 \u00af113.2\n</code></pre> <p>That\u2019s some extreme temperature right there! And it makes you start to wonder, how much temperature difference is the hull bearing? Turns out it\u2019s also very simple in APL:</p> <pre><code>      \u2395 \u2190 TEMP_DIFF \u2190 TEMP_OUTSIDE - TEMP_CELSIUS\n96.72222222 75.21111111 36.55555556 7.222222222 \u00af32.53333333 \u00af84.96666667 \u00af135.7\n</code></pre> <p>So applying a basic arithmetic function to two vectors also just applies them \u201ccomponent-wise\u201d! It just applies this function for the first element on the left and the first element on the right, note the result, then the second element on the left and the second element on the right, and so on. This is analogous to <code>map</code> with a binary operation and two iterators in Python, and <code>zipWith</code> in Haskell.

Given some starting note, we want to generate movements between the notes with some preference for certain special movements. </p> <p></p> <p>In the table above, red numerals represent a preferred following note.

Note that the next note depends only on the previous note, so we can represent this data as a graph.</p> <p></p> <p>Then, the data is a list of triples, consisting of the starting note, the ending note, and the color (or, priority) of the arrow between those notes. We can lay out this data in the form of a table as follows, where the row represents the starting note and the column represents the ending note. For example, the first row says that, for I as the starting note, we can get to I itself, II, or III with equal preference, 1 1 1.</p> <p></p> <p>We use  1  for standard movements and  2  for preferred movements.

This is very easily done using the matrix multiplication +.\u00d7 operator. This operator is actually the inner product operator . applied to the functions + and \u00d7, see [Inner and Outer product section]. Represent a note with scale degree N as a vector with a 1 in the Nth slot, and 0 otherwise, then matrix multiplication with M represents picking out the Nth row, which as we mentioned above corresponds to selecting the edges in the graph where N is the starting note.</p> <p>Recall that \u23737 is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7, this is equivalent to 2=1 2 3 4 5 6 7  The subsequence notes are I (Preferred), II, III (Preferred), and IV</p> <pre><code>      II \u2190 2=\u23737\n      II\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n      II+.\u00d7M\n2 1 2 1 0 0 0\n</code></pre> <p>Using this, we want to decide on a movement to another note, weighed by priority. One easy way to achieve this is using the roll ? function, which simulates the rolling of a dice with faces numbering 1 to the right argument. We will roll one die from 1 to 10, or 20 for preferred movements, for every possible following note, and pick the largest result.</p> <p>The subsequent notes are I, II, III, and IV  Multiplying by 10 to prepare to roll dice with 10, or 20, faces   Notice that ? 0 returns a random real number between 0 and 1  The Grade Down operator \u2352 returns the indices of the elements of the list from largest to smallest   Getting the index of the largest roll.

Let\u2019s enclose our note generation algorithm in a direct function and generate a melody.</p> <p>A direct function/dfn (pronounced dee-fun) is defined using {curly braces}. The right argument to the function is called \u2375, and the left \u237a.  Statements in a dfn can be separated by a \u22c4 diamond. However, only it stops as soon as a statement which returns a value is evaluated  The replicate / operator generates copies of its right argument elements depending on their left arguments  In this case, it replicates 0 of everything other than one copy of D</p> <pre><code>        10 {\u237a+\u2375} 2\n12\n      10 {\u237a+\u2375 \u22c4 \u237a-\u2375} 2 \n12\n\n      NEXT\u2190{(\u23737)=1\u2337\u2352?(\u2375\u00d710)+.\u00d7M} \n      NEXT 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\n      NOTES\u2190'CDEFGAB'\n      (0 1 0 0 0 0 0)/NOTES\nD\n</code></pre> <p> </p> <pre><code>      MELODY\u2190{res \u2190 NEXT \u2375 \u22c4 \u235e\u2190res/NOTES \u22c4 MELODY res}\n        MELODY 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nCDCECEGBGAGGGBBAAGBGEDEDFFEDCDCDECCDCECDECECEFEFEEGEGECEFEDEGBBBGBG\n</code></pre> <p>This function will run forever, generating notes until interrupted. One way of running the defun for a fixed number of steps is to add a variable representing the number of steps. We will use the left argument \u237a as this variable.</p> <p><pre><code>      MELODY\u2190{ \u237a \u2190 0 \u22c4 \u237a&gt;20: '\u266b' \u22c4 res \u2190 NEXT \u2375 \u22c4 \u235e\u2190res/NOTES \u22c4 (\u237a+1) MELODY res}\n      MELODY 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nCCDEGAFDCEGFDEDCDCECC\u266b\n</code></pre> Assigning a value to the left argument \u237a gives a dfns a default left argument. The assignment is only executed if the function is called monadically, that is, if there is no supplied left argument. In this case, the left argument \u237a starts at 0. The generation of the next note, the \"(\u237a+1) MELODY res\" statement, is executed with an incremented left argument. The guarded expression \u237a&gt;20: '\u266b' states that \u266b is returned when \u237a is becomes greater than 20. Since the execution of a dfn stops as soon as a statement returns a value, the code to generate the next note is no longer executed.</p> <p>This is the result we were after! With just a couple lines of APL, we were able to encode general guidelines for melodic composition and write a function generating random melodies according to these principles algorithmically by tracing out a random walk through a graph. These random graph processes are more generally known as Markov Processes and have a much broader range of applicability than our case here. Applications include the Google PageRank algorithm which powered the Google search engine, particle physics simulations of quantum field theory on a lattice, and speech recognition systems. </p> <p>There is clearly so much more we could add to our program, from generating rhythm to accompany the melody, to adding chord progressions and harmony, and there will always be more to add. We will however stop here to enjoy the melodies our program has generated, and leave it up to the interested reader to write their own digital musicians.</p> <p>Some of the generated melodies are included below.</p> <p>  Your browser does not support the audio element.  </p> <p>  Your browser does not support the audio element.  </p> <p>  Your browser does not support the audio element.  </p>"},{"location":"course/ch2/read/","title":"Read exercises","text":"<p>For each of the following exercises, try to figure out what the input will produce in the TryAPL terminal.
